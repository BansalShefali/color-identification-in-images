# color-identification-in-images
OpenCV which allows import and manipulation of images in Python. Also, information could be extracted out of those images using Machine Learning and used in some way.
The code can extract colors out of images and filter the images based on those colors.

I've also added the functionality of extracting WinRaR, for those uploading the input images folder through zipping the file.
